This package contains a matlab implementation of the MMS label denoising  algorithm

The DATA contains Salinas HSI data set, which can be used in simulation experiment. Extract Salinas data before use code

Pleae run the "Demo.m" file, which will run our LRMR algorithm on the Salinas data under SVM classification method. 

If you use this code, please cite the following paper:
